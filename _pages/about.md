I am a post-master's researcher at the <b>[Edge Computing Application Service Lab](https://www.etri.re.kr/eng/sub6/sub6_01020101.etri?departCode=93&departInfoCode=214)</b> at <b>[Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute  (ETRI)](https://www.etri.re.kr/eng/main/main.etri)</b>, a national facility in South Korea. Before joining ETRI, I worked at AISEED, a startup dedicated to developing edge AI solutions for the healthcare and agriculture industries.

I earned my master's degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering from Chonnam National University (CNU), a national university, under the guidance of <b>[Prof. Jinsul Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5c2UGQIAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao)</b>. Additionally, I also earned my bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering, with a double major in Computer Information and Communication Engineering, from CNU.

My current research interests include <b>efficient AI, edge AI, and mathematical machine learning</b>. As a computer scientist, I strive to create a world where no one is excluded from using personalized AI services, regardless of the limitations of their electronic devices.
